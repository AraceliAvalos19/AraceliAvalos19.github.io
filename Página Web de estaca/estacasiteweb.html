   <p>The February Full Moon is named after the snow on the ground. 
       Some Native American tribes named this the Hunger Moon; 
       others called it the Storm Moon. </p>
   <p>On our climate pages, you can see which month is the coldest,
       warmest, wettest, and windiest in cities all over the world.</p>
   <p> It is the cold, rising air that maximizes snowfall. The snowiest
       place in the United States is Paradise Ranger Station on Mount Rainier,
       WA, according to Alaska-based climatologist Dr. Brian Brettschneider 
       who has studied 30 years of snowfall in the US. The snowiest incorporated 
       city is Valdez, Alaska, while the snowiest place east of the Rockies 
       is Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire.</p>
   <p>February is the record snow month in some areas of the US, including in
       New York City, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Louisville, Portland,
       Tahoe City, and Washington DC. </p>
   <p>However, December and January hold the snowfall record in far more places,
       March and April in fewer places, and in some areas of Alaska, October and
       November statistically get the most snow.</p>
