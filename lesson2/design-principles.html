<h3>White space and clean design</h3>
<h4>Tifanny & Co.</h4>

<p>The right amount of white space makes a website look “clean.”
   While a clean design is crucial to communicate a clear message,
   it doesn’t just mean less content. </p>
<p>The amount of white space in Tifanny’s  web page makes this
   website looks clean. The white space makes it easy to focus 
   on the beautiful products. It has no visual competence, allows
   us to admire the jewels and easily find the information we need. </p>

<h3>Repetition</h3>

<h4>IN-N-OUT BURGER</h4>
<a href= "https://www.in-n-out.com/">in-n-out.com</a>
<img src="images/innoutok4.jpg" alt="in-n-out home page">

<p>Repetition is achieved by repeating an element more 
   than once throughout a design.</p>
  
<p> IN this web page the principle of repetition gives
   the feeling that the customer has control, since in a 
   simple and original way all navigation options are shown 
   and it is easy to choose what the user is looking for. 
   With this design, we can easily find a job, 
   a location or choose a hamburger.</p>

<h3> Contrast </h3>
<h4>MARS INCORPORATED</h4>
<a href= "https://www.mms.com/">mms.com</a>
<img src="images/mmsok4.jpg" alt="m&m´s home page">
<p> Through contrast designers are able to highlight 
   certain elements they want to emphasize, creating a 
   focal point for an audience and a visual hierarchy.</p>
<p> m & m´s image always handles colors. On this website, 
   the company manages the classic brown color that distinguishes it,
   the design is very simple, with simple shapes and contrasting colors 
   with brown. It is easy to read, easy to find what you are looking for.</p>
